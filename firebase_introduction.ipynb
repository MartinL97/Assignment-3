When building cross-platform apps using IOS, Android, and JavaScript software development kits (SDKs), all of the clients share a real-time database instance and automatically receive immediate data updates.\n"

    "## Benefits and Drawbacks of Firebase\n",
    "\n",
    "The pros and cons listed here are limited to the ones concerning the technology itself, anything concerning pricing or availability for example has been discarded.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits (mainly from [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database)):\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Ability to synchronize data in **real-time** across multiple devices and clients without the need for manual synchronization or polling.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Firebase Realtime Database can **scale** automatically to handle large amounts of data and high traffic.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ The database is optimized for **offline use**. Whenever a user performs changes offline, the database SDK uses a local cache on the device to serve and store changes. Whenever the user comes back online, the local data is automatically synchronized.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ The database offers a range of **security features**, including data encryption and authentication, to protect your data. You can specify who has access to which piece(s) of data and how the database should be structured.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Google Analytics for Firebase allows you to **track the users’ journey** through realtime and custom reporting. (from [InfoTrust](https://infotrust.com/articles/5-benefits-of-using-google-firebase/))\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Integrated **Machine Learning Functions** (from [back4app](https://blog.back4app.com/firebase-advantages-and-disadvantages/))\n",
    "\n",
    "+ ...\n",
    "\n",
    "### Drawbacks:\n",
    "\n",
    "[back4app](https://blog.back4app.com/firebase-advantages-and-disadvantages/) presents several disadvantages of using Firebase to build mobile or web apps.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Because of Firebase's **closed-source architecture**, app developers have very little control over the platform. Even if what Firebase provides does not meet the user's app development requirements, he cannot modify Firebase's code.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ It does **not support SQL Database**. The two databases available on Firebase are NoSQL databases. In essence, Firebase cannot support relational database structures and running complex database queries is still challenging on the platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ In contrast to SQL databases, Firebase database migration is **slow and complicated**.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ While Firestore has excellent features, it still has some **limiting quotas** such as: document size limited to 1MB, maximum of one million concurrent connections, maximum of 10MB API request size, not very flexible query pattern, ..."
